# OBJECT DETCTION 
      Nowadays Deep learning has gained a tremendous influence on how the world is adapting to Artificial Intelligence.This project will detect the object in front
     of it and it will respond back to the detected object. We had used openCV and YOLO for object detction and Django for front-end. This algorithm performs efficient object detection while not compromising on the performance.

## Main Feautures
    - Can detect the object in front of.
    - Respond back the object which it has detected.

## Application
    - Very useful for the blind people.
